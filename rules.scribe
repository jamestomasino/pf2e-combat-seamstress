# Combat Seamstress ((Combat Seamstress))
Calm and meticulous, the combat seamstress controls the flow of battle with needle, thread, and blade. Rather than overpowering foes, they bind space, allies, and enemies, shaping the fight through careful preparation and punishing missteps. Those who face a seamstress rarely fall in a single blow, instead realizing too late that every step has already been sewn into place.

## During combat encounters...
You shape the fight by controlling space and timing. You bind enemies, punish careless movement, and force opponents to act on your terms. Your power comes from preparation, positioning, and threatening enemy mobility.

## During social encounters...
You read people through details they do not realize they reveal. Repairs, posture, habits, and wear all tell stories. You speak carefully and precisely, and when needed, you apply subtle pressure rather than overt threats.

## While exploring...
You secure paths, reinforce gear, and prepare contingencies before danger appears. Traps, hazards, and sudden movement are less threatening when you have already planned how to limit them.

## In downtime...
You mend, modify, and experiment. Armor, clothing, tools, and threads become testbeds for new techniques. Your craft improves through constant refinement rather than inspiration.

## You Might...
* Treat preparation as a form of offense  
* Prefer control and certainty over improvisation  
* View movement and positioning as problems to be solved  

## Others Probably...
* Underestimate you until they are restrained  
* Find your patience unsettling  
* Notice that fights seem calmer when you are involved

# Class Features

## Ancestry and Background
In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.

## Initial Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Threadcraft
At 1st level, you can create supernatural threads as environmental hazards. They are visible, physical lines of reinforced thread stretched taut between two anchors. Threads do not block movement, line of effect, or line of sight. Instead, they impose consequences when a creature enters a square they occupy.

Unless otherwise stated, threads can only be anchored to **squares, terrain features, or unattended objects**. Anchoring threads to creatures requires a Weaving Style or feat.

|

### Thread Limits

You can maintain a number of threads equal to **1 plus your proficiency bonus in your Combat Seamstress class DC**.

A single thread cannot exceed **30 feet per proficiency rank** in your Combat Seamstress class DC.

Threads persist until severed or until you make your next daily preparations.

##### Table 1-3: Combat Seamstress Progression Summary ((+Tables))
Level | Class DC Proficiency | Active Threads | Maximum Thread Length | Tailored Defenses Prepared
--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 | Trained | 3 | 30 feet | —

14–15 | Master | 7 | 90 feet | 7
16–18 | Master | 7 | 90 feet | 7
19–20 | Legendary | 9 | 120 feet | 9

### Thread Effects

Each thread has **one effect slot**, chosen when the thread is created.

When a creature enters a square occupied by a thread during its own movement, the thread’s effect triggers. A thread can trigger only **once per creature per movement** unless an ability states otherwise.

The effects available to you are granted by class features and feats and typically impose conditions, movement penalties, or positional hindrances.

If you have an ability that allows you to exempt allies, you designate exempt creatures when you create a thread. Your exemption limit follows the standard progression for your proficiency (typically **1 plus your proficiency bonus in your Combat Seamstress class DC**). Any feats or abilities that modify or add to this limit apply. Exempt creatures do not trigger that thread’s effects, nor do they pay any action costs imposed by it.

=

item(
# Thread
## Hazard
-
; simple, environmental

**Description**  
A taut supernatural thread stretches between two anchors, humming faintly with restrained force.

### Basic Thread Effects

At 1st level, when you create a thread, you can choose one of the following **basic thread effects** to fill its effect slot.

Unless otherwise stated, a creature that triggers a thread attempts a saving throw against your Combat Seamstress class DC.

You gain additional thread effects through feats and class features.

|

### Forced Movement and Teleportation

Forced movement does not trigger threads.

If an anchor teleports, leaves the plane, or otherwise moves without traversing intervening space, the thread immediately unravels.

Threads do not prevent teleportation unless an ability explicitly states otherwise.

### Multiple Threads

If a creature encounters multiple threads during a single movement, each thread can trigger independently, subject to any limits imposed by your abilities.

item(
# Needle Throw ((+Needle Throw)) :a:
-
; attack, finesse, ranged, manipulate

**Range** 20 feet, increment 20 feet

Make a ranged Strike with a needle at an unoccupied square, an unattended object, or a held object you can clearly target. On a hit, you create or extend a thread anchored at the struck square or object, choosing the thread’s effect slot when it is created. The thread’s length cannot exceed your maximum thread length and it counts against your maximum number of threads.

If the target is an ordinary unattended object or an empty square with no listed AC, use DC 13 for this Strike. For other targets without a listed AC, use the DC by level.

**Tether Weave** If you have selected the Tether Weave style, you can target a creature with Needle Throw. On a hit, you create or extend a thread anchored at that creature, and the other end must be anchored to you, creating a tether. A creature can have only one tether to you at a time unless an ability states otherwise. A tether to a willing creature is protective, and a tether to an unwilling creature is hostile. A tether to an unwilling ally has no protective effects.

Creating or extending a thread with this action uses your Combat Seamstress class DC for any required saves or checks related to that thread.
)

=

## Tailor's Cut
When you critically hit with your tailor scissors, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. This damage die increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.

## Skill Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

## Combat Seamstress Feats 2nd
At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a Combat Seamstress class feat.

## Tailored Defenses 2nd

Beginning at 2nd level, you prepare subtle supernatural reinforcements woven directly into your clothing, armor, and accessories.

During your daily preparations, you can prepare a limited number of **tailored defenses**. A tailored defense represents reinforced seams, layered cloth, hidden weights, or protective treatments that remain effective until your next daily preparations.

Tailored defenses are not items and cannot be removed, transferred, or stolen.

### Tailored Defense Slots

You can prepare a limited number of tailored defenses at a time.

You gain a number of Tailored Defense Slots equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus in your Combat Seamstress class DC.

You can prepare the same tailored defense more than once only if it explicitly allows it.

### Using Tailored Defenses

Unless otherwise stated, tailored defenses apply only to you.

Some tailored defenses provide passive benefits. Others grant a single-use or limited-use effect that is expended when triggered. Once expended, a tailored defense provides no further benefit until your next daily preparations.

Starting at 6th level, you can prepare tailored defenses for willing allies. Choose the ally during your daily preparations; the defense functions only while that ally wears or carries the tailored garment or accessory.

|

### Basic Tailored Defenses

When you first gain Tailored Defenses, you can prepare any of the following options.

item(
# Reinforced Seams ((+Reinforced Seams))
## Tailored Defense
-
; defense

Your clothing and armor are reinforced with dense, overlapping stitching.

You gain resistance to physical damage equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus in your Combat Seamstress class DC.
)

item(
# Slip-Lined Hem ((+Slip-Lined Hem))
## Tailored Defense
-
; mobility

Your garments are lined to slide against grasping hands and sudden pulls.

You gain a +2 item bonus to checks and DCs to resist being Grappled, Restrained, or Shoved.
)

item(
# Tatter-Cloak ((+Tatter-Cloak))
## Tailored Defense
-
; illusion, defense, consumable

Loose strips and layered cloth fly free from your outfit, disrupting your silhouette.

**Trigger** :r: You are targeted by an attack.

You gain total concealment against that attack and against any further attacks until the start of your next turn, then this tailored defense is expended.
)

### Advanced Tailored Defenses

item(
# Outfit Reinforcement ((+Outfit Reinforcement))
## Tailored Defense
-
; defense
**Prerequisites** 6th level

You reinforce a creature’s clothing or armor with dense stitching and weighted hems.

The prepared creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC.
)

item(
# Distracting Fringe ((+Distracting Fringe))
## Tailored Defense
-
; defense
**Prerequisites** 6th level

Loose tassels and layered seams tug at sightlines.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks.
)

=

item(
# Quick Disguise Kit ((+Quick Disguise Kit))
## Tailored Defense
-
; utility, consumable
**Prerequisites** 6th level

You assemble a flexible disguise kit from tailored pieces and reversible stitching.

The prepared creature gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate while wearing the tailored outfit. The first time the prepared creature attempts an Impersonate check, this tailored defense is expended.
)

item(
# Camouflage Stitching ((+Camouflage Stitching))
## Tailored Defense
-
; illusion
**Prerequisites** 10th level

You pattern a garment with light-bending threadwork.

Choose a terrain (such as forest, urban, or desert). The prepared creature gains a +2 item bonus to Stealth checks while in that terrain.
)

item(
# Evasive Stitch ((+Evasive Stitch))
## Tailored Defense
-
; mobility, consumable
**Prerequisites** 10th level

Your stitching loosens at the exact moment to slip away from danger.

**Trigger** You succeed at a Reflex saving throw.

You treat the result as a critical success, then this tailored defense is expended.
)

item(
# Seam of Deflection ((+Seam of Deflection))
## Tailored Defense
-
; defense, consumable
**Prerequisites** 10th level

Heavy reinforcing thread catches the worst of the blow.

:f: **Trigger** You are hit by a Strike.  
If the triggering Strike is a critical hit, it is a normal hit instead. Reduce the damage by 10 (15 at 16th level), then this tailored defense is expended.
)

|

## Living Fabric

You can animate cloth and fabric you have previously handled through subtle supernatural tailoring.

You can affect only cloth or fabric you have touched since your last daily preparations, and only while it remains within your maximum thread range.

Living fabric is not a creature or hazard and cannot attack, restrain, or deal damage unless a feat explicitly allows it.

item(
# Living Fabric Manipulation ((+Living Fabric Manipulation))
## :a:
-
; manipulate

You momentarily animate a piece of cloth or fabric.

Choose one of the following effects:
* Tug, wrap, loosen, tighten, or shift fabric
* Hold or reposition an unattended cloth or fabric object
* Catch or redirect a falling cloth or fabric object
* Briefly shape fabric into a simple form

The effect resolves immediately and does not persist beyond this action.
)

item(
# Sustained Living Fabric ((+Sustained Living Fabric))
## :aa:
-
; manipulate
**Traits** manipulate

You shape or animate fabric into a more complex or load-bearing form.

You can create a temporary structure or tool made of cloth, such as a rope, ladder, sling, curtain, or padding. The structure persists for **up to 1 minute**. It can support the weight of a Medium creature and typical gear; greater loads are subject to GM discretion. The structure collapses when the duration ends or once it has served its immediate purpose.
)

item(
# Living Fabric Arrest ((+Living Fabric Arrest))
-
; manipulate

**Trigger** :r: You or a creature within range wearing or attached to fabric would take falling damage.

You animate nearby fabric to slow the fall.

Treat the fall as **20 feet shorter** for the triggering creature. This cannot prevent a fall entirely.
)

=

## General Feats 3rd
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.

## Skill Increases 3rd
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase.

## Ability Boosts 5th
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.

## Ancestry Feats 5th
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

/

---

# Weaving Styles ((+Weaving Styles))

At 3rd level, you choose a weaving style that defines how your threads interact with creatures and the battlefield. Your weaving style changes what your threads can target, how they trigger, and what kinds of effects they enable.

/

## Tether Weave

Tether Weave alters your threads to bind creatures directly. You can tether enemies to punish escape or tether allies to prepare protection.

### Creature Anchoring
You can target creatures with Needle Throw to create tethers (see Needle Throw).

### Tethered Awareness
You always know the precise location of a creature tethered to you.

For **your attacks only**, a hostile tethered creature does not benefit from the concealed or invisible conditions against you. This does not affect other creatures’ attacks, and it does not negate other defensive benefits such as cover.

For willing tethered allies, you can communicate simple intent through the tether as a free action, at the GM’s discretion. This awareness represents constant physical feedback through the tether, not visual perception.

|

### Hostile Tether Triggers
A hostile tether is a thread and uses its thread effect slot as normal, but it does not trigger when encountered by other creatures.

If the tethered creature takes any movement or action that would increase its distance from you, treat the squares that increase distance as difficult terrain for that creature while it is attempting that movement.

Tethers trigger their effects only when the tethered creature **Strides**. Movement that does not involve a Stride, such as Step or forced movement, does not trigger tether effects.

### Protective Tethers
Tethers to willing allies do not impose movement penalties and do not trigger on ally movement.

You spend actions to prepare protective tethers on tethered allies. These tethers last until the start of your next turn or until triggered, whichever comes first.

=

### Protective Tether Triggers
Protective tethers trigger when their specified condition is met, such as taking damage, failing a saving throw, or being targeted by an attack. When a protective tether triggers, it is consumed.

### Breaking Tethers
A tether unravels if the tethered creature teleports, leaves the plane, or becomes extradimensional. Forced movement does not break tethers.

## Lattice Weave

Lattice Weave emphasizes dense environmental threading that taxes movement and punishes careless positioning.

|

### Enhanced Environmental Threads
When a creature encounters one of your threads during its own movement, it triggers normally. If the creature continues moving through the thread’s square, that movement costs **1 additional action**.

This action cost is paid immediately after the triggering movement. If the creature does not have an additional action available, the thread triggers and the creature’s movement ends immediately.

### Layered Geometry
If a creature encounters multiple of your threads during a single movement, each thread can trigger independently.
